This stable release is a mandatory upgrade for all mainnet Nxt nodes.

A hardfork to activate several new features that have already been enabled on
testnet in 1.12.0e has been scheduled for block 2870000, expected around April
15, 2020. The following new features will be activated on mainnet:

    Asset Dividends payment by asset or currency, allowing paying asset
    dividends not only in NXT, but also in any asset or monetary system
    currency.

    Asset Properties, setting arbitrary name/value metadata on assets.

    Asset Increase transaction, allowing asset issuers to increase the total
    number of asset shares available.

More details about the above features were published in the previous 1.12.0e
changelog.

Optimize checkpoint calculation by using hash of checkpoint block bytes
instead of hashing all intermediate transactions.

Simplified setting up https on a public node without the need for a reverse
proxy. The new pem.to.pkcs12.keystore.certbot.hook.sh script can be used to
convert an SSL certificate issued by Let's Encrypt to a keystore file that
the Nxt node can use. The run.sh script now supports authbind, if started with
the --authbind modified, to allow the Nxt software to listen on port 443
without having to run it as root.

A new managePeersNetworking API has been added, to allow disabling or
enabling the node peer networking at runtime. It takes a single "operation"
parameter, with possible values: "enable", "disable", and "query", and
requires the adminPassword when run on a public node.

Added a new GetEpochTime API, to return the blockchain epoch time given a unix
timestamp.

Added a new property nxt.stopDownloadHeight to allow forcing the blockchain
download to stop once a certain height is reached.

The compact.sh script has been improved to better reduce the database size.
A new property has been added, nxt.disableCompactOnShutdown=false to allow
disabling database compact on shutdown, for faster restarts during development.

A new property has been added, nxt.deleteProcessedVotes=true, to optionally
disable the deletion of votes records when trimming the votes table. Note
that even if votes are not deleted, re-calculation of poll results may require
data that are no longer available (such as account or asset balances at the
time of poll finish), unless a blockchain rescan is done, this is why the
default is still to delete old votes records.

Various UI fixes and improvements.

Updated Jetty to version 9.3.28, H2 to 1.4.200. If using a custom nxt.dbParams
or nxt.dbUrl properties, remove any MVCC settings from them, MVCC is now the
default and not configurable.
